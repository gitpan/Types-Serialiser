Revision history for Perl extension Types::Serialiser

	- document the Types::Serialisation protocol, in the hope
          of other modules picking it up.
        - alias JSON::PP::Boolean as class for booleans, without
          introducing a dependency to it. It's ugly, but allows
          JSON::PP to stay in core without dependency to
          Types::Serialiser.
        - actually add a simple testcase.
